SCHEDULER APPLICATION - Samuel Sakari Paunonen

A simple scheduler application that has features like drag to add and event search.

The application uses react with javascript on the front end with tailwind as css. 
The frontend is connected to the backend using a simple axios api.

On the backend there is a very simple express server that is connected to a mongoDB database that
stores all the users and their schedules, accessable by a username and a password.
